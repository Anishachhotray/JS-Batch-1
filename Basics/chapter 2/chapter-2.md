1)In the expression `8 * 4`, identify the operands and the operator.

ans: operands- 8 and 4
     operator- *

2)What will be the value of `x` after this code runs?
let x = 10;
x += 5;

ans: 15

3)What is the result of this comparison:Explain your answer. 
  7 == "7"

ans: true,because here loose operator is used which only checks the value not the data type.

4)Write a JavaScript statement that checks if a number `n` is **not** equal to `10` (using strict comparison).

ans: 

5)What does the following code output? Why?
let a = 3;
let b = 2;
console.log(a > 2 && b = 50) {
  result = "Pass";
} else {
  result = "Fail";
}

ans: Fail,because a>2 is a true statement but b=50 is a false statement and true && false gives false so the else block will be executed.

6)What is the value of `msg` after this code executes?
let msg = "Hello";
msg += " World!";

ans: HelloWorld!

7)What will this code print? Explain your answer.
console.log(typeof "123");
console.log(typeof 123);

ans: First one will be string because 123 is written within double quotes and anything written within double  quotes will be considered as string.Second one will be number because simply numbers are written.

8)Write a statement that checks if `arr` is an array using an operator.

ans:

9)What is the output of this code? Why?
let x = 5;
let y = "5";
console.log(x === y);
console.log(x == y);

ans: x===y is false as strict equality operator  checks both data type and value.x==y is true beacuse of the use of loose equality operator which checks only value.
